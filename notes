questions:

Does b^d chain need to know b^{d+1} blockheaders?


If a reorg on b^d makes b^{d+1} invalid then we can to a first order guarantee
proper ordering of events.


* Mining

Always done with a full suite of blocks from from b^0 to b^d

"Boxed" difficulties: if PoW is valid for a given chain difficulty it must be
the best known block.

Enforce alternating pattern so that 51% attack resources *can't* be brought to
bear on an isolated part of the chain. Issue: How much worse are consensus
requirements? Orphan rate will go up a bit due to boxed difficulties. Or maybe
not an issue?


Note how all transactions are now two phase commits: mark coins as spent
followed by create new outputs.

make sure to get andrew miller's ideas on formalizing what kind of proof we get
out of all this
